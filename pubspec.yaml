  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Bayon
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/Bayon-Regular.ttf
     - family: Moul
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/Moul-Regular.ttf
     - family: Metal
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/Metal-Regular.ttf

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
